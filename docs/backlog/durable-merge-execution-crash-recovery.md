# Durable merge execution crash recovery

Source: docs/BACKLOG.md@05f97302492d26112f877bc2a97acb2578aca8df, migrated 2026-09-14

- **Trigger**: When a caller-owned durable merge receipt directory and recovery authority are standardized.
- **Context**: A process crash after one ordered merge edge can lose the in-memory aggregate receipt; P3 intentionally omitted a WAL because its frozen contract supplied no storage-path authority.
- **Effort**: S（re-estimate under the new ticket contract）
- **Source**: depth-0; p3-risk
