- **Status**: CONDITIONAL — retained post-merge follow-up；trigger 尚未成立，no active implementation worktree。
- **Trigger**: Before automatic durable resume, reviewer roster rotation, seat retry, or more than one candidate per repair generation is enabled.
- **Context**: Make all durable stop payloads pass verbatim resume validation, bind full-diff barriers to the exact candidate and review kind, and include sealed reviewer roster/seat identities in full-diff and joint-review reuse keys.
- **Effort**: S（re-estimate under the new ticket contract）
