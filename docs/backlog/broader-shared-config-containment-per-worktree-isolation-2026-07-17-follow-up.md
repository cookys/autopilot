# broader shared-config containment / per-worktree isolation（2026-07-17, follow-up）

Source: docs/BACKLOG.md@05f97302492d26112f877bc2a97acb2578aca8df, migrated 2026-09-14


- **Trigger**: when a dispatched worker poisons a non-identity shared `.git/config` key
  (e.g. `core.hooksPath`, `credential.helper`) or when multi-worktree concurrent dispatch
  needs stronger isolation than emit-time restore.
- **Context**: v2.32.51 identity rail contains ONLY `user.name`/`user.email` (local scope).
  Other keys in the shared `.git/config` remain uncontained. Candidate directions: snapshot/
  restore a broader key denylist, or per-worktree config isolation via
  `extensions.worktreeConfig` so a worktree cannot write through to the shared config.
- **Accepted limitations of the current rail** (do not re-litigate as bugs of v2.32.51):
  1. Drift compare is **point-in-time** at emit — a worker that sets a bad identity, commits
     with it, then restores the original before exit is undetected on its own worktree commits.
  2. An **escaped descendant** could re-poison the shared config after emit-time restore
     (containment is teardown hygiene, not a malicious-worker boundary).
- **Effort**: L (design + isolation semantics).
- **Source**: 2026-07-17 U1b panel findings remediation on identity-containment port.
