<!-- AUTOPILOT_CODEX_LIFECYCLE_ADAPTER_V1 -->

## Codex lifecycle adapter (normative override)

This section overrides any later host-specific lifecycle or dispatch spelling in the canonical skill
body. Resolve `<plugin-root>` as the installed Autopilot plugin directory that contains this skill.

Before any write, branch, worktree, runner, provider, or model effect, enter through:

```text
node "<plugin-root>/scripts/session-mode.js" set --level <l3|l4|l5|l6> --entry-level <requested-level> --repo-root <git-root>
```

Codex supplies `CODEX_THREAD_ID` to that shell process. `session-mode.js` records the normalized host
thread ID in both the marker filename and `session_id`; do not replace it with a caller-chosen stable
ID. A marker from another Codex thread is not reusable.

Continue only when the emitted marker contains `mission_routing.status: "READY"`, `admitted: true`, and
`would_block: false`. Managed implementation then follows the existing Mission admission, sealed
campaign, and `AUTOPILOT_LEVEL=<level> node
"<plugin-root>/bin/autopilot.js" engine implement-review ...`
route. Repairs attach to and resume that same engine/campaign lineage. A Codex implementer launched
inside that route receives a credentials-only isolated `CODEX_HOME`, never the controller plugin or
configuration.

Codex in this package does not provide `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskStop`, native `Agent`, or
`subagent_type`. Do not imitate them with Markdown tickets, inline managed implementation, a new
branch/session, or a replacement graph. If an exact mapping is unavailable, stop with the existing
precondition or abort receipt; do not invent another lifecycle authority.
