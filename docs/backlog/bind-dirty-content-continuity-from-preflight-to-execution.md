# Bind dirty content continuity from preflight to execution

Source: docs/BACKLOG.md@05f97302492d26112f877bc2a97acb2578aca8df, migrated 2026-09-14

- **Trigger**: When merge preflight schema v2 is designed or a consumer requires cross-phase content-continuity proof.
- **Context**: P3 detects content drift after execution starts, but cannot prove preserved bytes are unchanged since P2 issuance because the P2 receipt binds path categories rather than content/index digests.
- **Effort**: S（re-estimate under the new ticket contract）
- **Source**: depth-0; p3-risk
